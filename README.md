# insights-api
## Question C

Create an api that takes a string as input and returns a list of text insights from the top 5 google results of the query generated by those keywords. 
Test with the following string « keystone - Circular reference found role inference » . You will need to build a query , search the web (you can scrape google) , select the top 5 results and for each result scrape for the most relevant information on that page (relevant from a user’s perspective based on the original string ) . The response should contain the links to the websites that were scraped with the most relevant information (could be a text insight ,  a code snippet, a patch file, etc.) for each. In the response, feel free to add any other extra information that you think could be relevant.

## Approach

* In order to avoid frequently scraping both google and top 5 pages it is a good idea to store those searches and save time. Thus, instead of googling again we might query for a similar entry on our database first.

## Database

* I chose to use a NoSql database (MongoDB).
* It is not necessary to update a search already stored, the top 5 results do not change often.
* Since this application hardly ever updates records and it has a high demand for reading operations, I think a NoSql database fits better.
* We can have different relevant information regarding a page, documents are flexibel concerning its structure.
* Using capped collections the older documents are removed. Imagine how many searches will be done, maybe it is not necessary to store all of them forever. Not for the goal of this API. One can check it in details here https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/capped-collections/.


## Future Features
* Give to the user the possibility of re-doing the search for real, I mean, to scrap the web again
